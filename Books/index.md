I like to read a lot of things at one time. I haven't actually finished any of them yet, because I'm one of [these people](http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/love-your-work-episode-12-stop-reading-books-straight-through-start-reading-in-layers/).
My list is always expanding and I'm open to read mainly anything; currently I'm more fixated on the ones on the product side of things.
