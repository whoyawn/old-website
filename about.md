I'm a student studying at the University of California, Irvine under the school of Informatics, with a
specialization in computer software development and user experience design. I have a passion for learning
and technology, and outside of school I am part of groups such as the iOS OC meetup and User Experience
meetup, so you'll find me frequently going to such events.

What do I like to do in my free time? Well, I've been becoming a recent fan of:

{% highlight swift %}
print("Things I like to do:\n")
for thing in stuffThatILike {
    print(thing)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Things I like to do:

building iOS apps\\
MOOCS\\
[books]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/)\\
hackathons\\
powerlifting\\
tennis\\
mechanical keyboards\\
anime
