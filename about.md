I'm a student studying at the University of California, Irvine under the school of Informatics, with a
specialization in computer software development and user experience design. I have a passion for learning
and technology, and outside of school I am part of groups such as iOS OC meetup and User Experience
meetup, so you'll find me frequently going to such events.

What do I like to do in my free time? Well I've been becoming a recent fan of:

MOOCS
